# battleshipBlueTeam
Blue Team's Battleship game for CSC 520 final project.


Required Software:
NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/download (refer to npm download first)
MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/
npm - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Setup:
I believe you should be able to simple npm install in the root directory of the project.
Make sure MongoDB has started. I have problems starting it occasionally on Ubuntu, dm me and I can send you a helpful link.
run: nodemon app.js
